# Stimulated-Raman-Adiabatic-Passage-STIRAP-
This project explores the implementation and numerical simulation of Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage (STIRAP)â€”a coherent quantum state transfer technique. STIRAP enables population transfer between quantum states without losses due to spontaneous emission.
